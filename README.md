# Turborepo tryout

This repo started as an experiment with various configs. Along the way, it’s naturally evolving into more of a Turborepo boilerplate. Some explanations are included, both to help others understand the setup and for future reference for myself 😄.

- The monorepo was bootstrapped using `create-turbo@latest`.
- The Next.js app was created with `create-next-app`.
- Vitest configuration is based on the official docs, the Turborepo Vitest example, and a fair bit of trial, error, and AI-assisted problem solving.

## Turborepo setup

### Apps

- frontend: a NextJS/React app
  - **Tech stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vitest
  - **Vitest tests**:
    - “browser” tests
      - Run in a **real browser** (Chromium via Playwright)
      - Used for component rendering, interactions, and UI behavior
      - Powered by Vitest’s Browser Mode
      - need to be named `*.browser.test.tsx` to be taken into account
    - “node” tests
      - Run in a **Node.js** environment
      - Fast unit tests for utilities, server logic, hooks, etc.
      - Use Vitest + jsdom
      - need to be named `*.test.ts` to be taken into account
- …

### Packages

- **eslint-config** – shared ESLint configuration
- **typescript-config** – shared TypeScript configuration
- **vitest-config** – shared Vitest configuration
- …

- How to set up a Turborepo monorepo with shared ESLint, TypeScript, and Vitest configuration
- How to configure Vitest for both Node (jsdom) and Browser (Playwright) testing
